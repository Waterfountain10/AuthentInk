# AuthentInk: Signature Forgery Detector

## Introduction

### Inspiration
In 2021, 15 million Americans were victims of identity theft, underscoring the urgent need for enhanced security in our digital world. AuthentInk was born from a shared passion for combating signature forgery in digital transactions and documents.

### Purpose
AuthentInk offers a robust solution to protect individuals and organizations from the risks of forged signatures, crucial in today's era of digital transactions.

## Features

### How It Works
AuthentInk leverages advanced Siamese Neural Networks (Siamese NN) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to authenticate signatures.

1. **Signature Input**: Capture signature images using a PyQt5 application.
2. **Authentication**: Compare signatures against a pre-trained dataset, using Siamese NN.
3. **Result**: Determine signature authenticity based on similarity scores.

### Development Process
- Data Acquisition: Kaggle datasets.
- Data Preprocessing: Standardization for consistency.
- Training: Siamese NN with contrastive loss.
- Interface: Developed with PyQt5, including camera functionality.
